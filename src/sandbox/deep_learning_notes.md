- **Convolution:** Take small square sections of an image and "simplify" what's in that window by blending the values of all the pixels in the window into a single pixel.

    - **(Max) Pooling:** Pooling: the method by which each square is simplified. Max Pooling: specifically using the maximum pixel value in the square to be the value of the simplified square.
